  summary: Astronomical source extraction and photometry library
  description: |
    SEP makes the core algorithms of Source Extractor available as a
    library of stand-alone functions and classes. These operate directly
    on in-memory arrays (no FITS files or configuration files). The code
    is derived from the Source Extractor code base (written in C) and aims
    to produce results compatible with Source Extractor whenever possible.
